# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository packages the Claude Code CLI as a [Dev Container Feature](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/). Features are self-contained units of installation code and configuration that can be added to devcontainers. The feature is published to the GitHub Container Registry on pushes to `main`.

## Development Commands

Requires `@devcontainers/cli` installed globally: `npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`

### Validate feature metadata

```
devcontainer features test --validate-only
```

### Run tests

All tests for the claude-code feature:
```
devcontainer features test -f claude-code .
```

Autogenerated tests only (smoke tests across base images, no scenarios):
```
devcontainer features test --skip-scenarios -f claude-code -i ubuntu:latest .
```

Scenario tests only:
```
devcontainer features test -f claude-code --skip-autogenerated --skip-duplicated .
```

Global scenario tests:
```
devcontainer features test --global-scenarios-only .
```

## Architecture

Each feature lives under `src/<feature-name>/` with two required files:
- `devcontainer-feature.json` — metadata, options, VS Code extensions, mounts, install ordering
- `install.sh` — shell script executed during container build

Tests live under `test/<feature-name>/`:
- `scenarios.json` — defines named test scenarios, each specifying a base image and feature options
- `test.sh` — scenario test script using the `dev-container-features-test-lib` framework (`check` assertions + `reportResults`)
- `basic.sh` — standalone smoke test (plain bash, no test framework)

The release workflow (`release.yaml`) auto-generates `README.md` files for each feature via `devcontainers/action` and opens a PR with the generated docs.

## Conventions

- Install scripts use `/bin/sh` (not bash) for broader compatibility
- Install scripts should be idempotent (check if already installed before re-installing)
- Feature JSON uses `installsAfter` to declare ordering dependencies on other features
- The `mounts` field in feature JSON creates persistent volumes for configuration that should survive container rebuilds
